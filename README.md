# Neural Network construction from a Optimization perspective

My solutions to series of exercises concerning the construction of NNs from a Optimization perspective. These exercises tie in traditional Optimization course contents with the core structure of Neural Networks.

These exercises were proposed by Prof. Hughes Talbot during his Advanced Optimization course for MSc in Data Sciences and Business Analytics. All credit goes to the professor for the excellent exercises and notebook structure.
